# freesurferQCing
scripts to do manual quality checks of cortical and subcortical surfaces and volumes

## Autorecon-all ##

Note: this can only be done once the subject directory has been moved to Sherlock Oak

Log onto the Sherlock server in terminal: ```ssh SUNet@login.sherlock.stanford.edu```
Then, ```cd $OAK```
Then, ```cd TIGER_data/TIGER_FreeSurfer/TIGER_FS_bin```
Run either TIGER_sherlock.sh or TIGER2_sherlock.sh depending on the timepoint (XX = ID):
```
sbatch -t 2-00 -p iang ./TIGER_sherlock.sh XX
```
This will run FreeSurfer recon-all for that subject, which takes ~7 hours. Note you can submit multiple jobs at once, one after the other if you have several subjects to be run (meaning, you donâ€™t need to wait for one to finish before starting the next)

Check to see if FreeSurfer is done running by going here to look for the subject: ```TIGER_data/TIGER_FreeSurfer/TIGER_FS_subjDir/```

Additionally, you can check to see the status of your jobs on Sherlock using this command:
```squeue -u SUNet```

## QCing subcortical autosegmentation ##

```cd /Volumes/group/proc/TIGERanalysis/TIGER_FreeSurfer/TIGER_FS_bin/```

(XX=ID, TX= timepoint; e.g. 14-T1): ```./tiger_checkAseg.sh XX-TX```
